# Optimal Secret Santa

**Optimal Secret Santa** is a simple web application that allows a group of at least 3 people to generate gift exchange assignments via email.

Go to http://bit.ly/optimalsanta and have fun!  

Or see it in action on [Youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qbax0_2-7Fk) 

**Features**
* No account registration required! Just provide the names and emails of each member
* No spam! We encrypt and store your emails, and will never send you unnecessary emails (unlike some online Secret Santa apps...)
* Automatically emails each person their gift assignment (who to give to)
* Lets each member send a message, such as a wishlist, to the email of their Secret Santa without knowing who they are
* Each member's Secret Santa remains anonymous, you can't use math to guess who your Secret Santa is
* You will never be assigned to yourself
* If A is giving a gift to B, we won't generate a pairing where B is also giving to A

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See **Deployment** for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The minimum requirements are `python-3.7.5` and `pip`.
The required packages are in `requirements.txt`.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your computer.

```
git clone https://github.com/benleone90/OptimalSecretSanta.git
```
Install `virtualenv` to create a Python virtual environment in this directory.
```
python -m pip install --user virtualenv
python -m venv venv
```
(**Optional**) Update your `venv` to the latest supported version of `python`.
```
python -m venv --upgrade YOUR_VENV_PATH
```
Activate the virtual environment then install all the requirements.
```
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You will need to edit the environmental variables to the email account you are using. The `SECRET_KEY` will be used for the unique url token generation.
In `app.py`:
```
MAIL_USERNAME='put_your_email@address.com',
MAIL_PASSWORD='your_password',
SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key',
```
To run the website locally,
```
flask run
```
then navigate to http://localhost:5000/ or wherever the Flask website is running.

## Deployment

## Testing

To test the algorithm locally without deploying the web app, run `test.py` inside the [misc](misc) folder.
```
$ python test.py
Panat (3) -> Ben   (0)
Ben   (0) -> Josh  (1)
Josh  (1) -> Wiley (2)
Wiley (2) -> Ken   (4)
Ken   (4) -> Panat (3)

```
